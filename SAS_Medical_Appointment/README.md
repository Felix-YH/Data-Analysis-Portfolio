# Project Description
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis project focused on medical appointment data. The project utilizes SAS (Statistical Analysis System) to perform a comprehensive analysis of the dataset. The objective is to gain insights into various aspects of medical appointments, including factors influencing appointment attendance and patient demographics

# Data Description
The dataset used for this analysis can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments?resource=download&select=KaggleV2-May-2016.csv) It includes information about medical appointments, such as patient demographics, appointment dates, appointment characteristics, and whether the patient showed up for the appointment. The dataset is in CSV format and is named medical_appointment_data.csv.

# Analysis 
Below are the questions I seek answers to:
- What is the percentage of no-shows?
- What are the factors that may affect whether a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment or not?
- Is there any effect of Gender on whether a patient will show up for the booked appointment or not?
- Are patients with scholarships more likely to miss their appointments?
- Are patients who don’t receive SMS more likely to miss their appointment?
- Does the time difference between the scheduling and appointment have any impact on whether a patient will show up for their appointment or not?
- Does a patient’s age affect whether a patient will show up or not?
- What are the five neighborhoods with the highest number of patients missing their appointments from all the neighborhoods.?
- On which weekdays people don’t show up most often?
