# Project Description

## When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?
In this project I examined sales information for the top 400 video games released since
1977 along with critic and user ratings for video games for this project. I looked for a video game "golden age" by identifying popular release years among players and reviewers, and I investigated the business of gaming by studying sales statistics.
I also  combined datasets for my search, then use set theory to compare the outcomes. Similarly, I filtered, grouped, and ordered Video Games dataset.

## Analyze International Debt Statistics
In this project I examined data on global debt gathered by The World Bank. The dataset includes data on the total amount of debt (in US dollars) owing by developing nations in several categories. In this project I answered questions like :
  * What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
  * Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
  * What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
